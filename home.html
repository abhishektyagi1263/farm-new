        Every day, everyone is impacted by crop science. You may be familiar with farm fields – or fresh produce 
        from the store. Behind the scenes, crop scientists are working to make sure we have a constant, nutritious 
        food supply. They breed new crops resistant to pests and other diseases. They enhance the nutritional 
        quality and flavor of foods. They are studying crops to make sure we have food during droughts and floods, 
        heat and cold, and other weather events.

        Principle feed crops include corn, barley, wheat, and oats. Each of these crops has different properties 
        that are better suited for some animals’ diets over others. Barley, which is harder to digest, is most 
        often fed to beef and dairy cattle because they have a tough, four-chambered stomach. Hull-less barley,
         which is easier to digest, is fed to swine and poultry.

        Fiber crops, such as cotton and hemp, are harvested for textile and paper products. Textiles, or cloth, 
        are made from the dried and processed fibers of certain plants. Most fibers used to make textiles are taken
        from the stem or roots of plants such as flax. Flax is used to make linen.

        <p>भंवरपाल सिंह को गेहूं, मिर्च और धान की खेती के लिए भी कई जिला स्तरीय पुरस्कार मिले हैं। 
        भंवरपाल सिंह कहते हैं, "पहले भी मुझे कई बार सम्मानित किया गया था, लेकिन अगर मैं अपने लिए सबसे गौरवपूर्ण दिन की बात करूं 
        तो अक्टूबर, 2013 को वर्तमान प्रधानमंत्री और गुजरात के तत्कालीन मुख्यमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी ने देश के पांच सौ जिले के पांच सौ किसानों में से
         हमको सम्मानित किया। वो हमारे लिए सबसे खुशी का दिन था।

        Modern farming technology is used to improve the wide types of production practices employed by farmers. 
        It makes use of hybrid seeds of selected variety of a single crop, technologically advanced equipment and
         lots of energy subsidies in the form of irrigation water, fertilizers and pesticides.

        Sprinkler Irrigation
It is an easy and simple method of irrigation nowadays. Water is provided to the fields by spraying water
 droplets, similar to rain, through pipes. Any loss of water is avoided in the sprinkler system. Problem of 
 waterlogging is not present in this system. The balance of groundwater is also maintained.
Sprinkler irrigation is done in areas with less water and uneven ground level. The main pipeline is laid in the 
field. They are joined to perpendicular pipelines with rotating nozzles. Water from the tube-wells is allowed to
 pass through these pipelines under pressure, which escapes from the rotating nozzles and gets sprinkled on the 
 crops.

    NEW DELHI (CIMMYT) — The new Soil Intelligence System (SIS) for India will help the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha rationalize the costs of generating high-quality soil data and build accessible geospatial information systems based on advanced geostatistics. The SIS initiative will rely on prediction rather than direct measurements to develop comprehensive soil information at scale. The resulting data systems will embrace FAIR access principles — findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible — to support better decision-making in agriculture.
</p>

   <p>
    SIS is a $2.5 million investment funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This initiative is led by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), in collaboration with numerous partners including the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), World Soil Information (ISRIC), the Andhra Pradesh Space Applications Center (APSAC), and the state governments and state agriculture universities of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar. The initiative runs from September 2018 through February 2021.
</p>

    <p>
    
    “SIS will make important contributions towards leveraging soil information for decision-making in Indian agriculture by devising new soil health management recommendations,” explained Andrew McDonald, CIMMYT’s Regional Team Leader for Sustainable Intensification and Project Leader for the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia (CSISA). Researchers and scientists will combine mapping outputs with crop response and landscape reconnaissance data through machine-learning analytics to derive precise agronomy decisions at scale.
